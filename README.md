# fce360-enhanced (FCEUX-360 tweaks)

Enhanced Xbox 360 port of the FCEUX NES emulator focused on front-end responsiveness. Core emulation code remains intact; improvements are limited to the Xbox UI layer (XUI scenes, input cadence, list scrolling).

> **Note:** Code hasn't been touched since around 2016, so I'm giving it some love with UI improvements and modern features while preserving the original emulation core.

* Target: Xbox 360 (RGH/JTAG), retail-runnable `.xex`

## What's new (v0.5.1)

* **Recent Games List:** Automatically tracks the last 15 played ROMs and displays them at the top of the ROM browser with a `[Recent]` prefix. Recent games persist across sessions and are saved to `fceui.ini`. A visual separator (`---`) distinguishes recent games from the full ROM list. Recent games are included in search results and the list automatically refreshes when returning to the ROM browser.

## What's new (v0.5.0)

* **ROM Search:** Press **Y button** in the ROM browser to open the Xbox 360 on-screen keyboard. Enter a game name to filter the ROM list in real-time with case-insensitive partial matching. Empty search shows all ROMs.

---

## What's new (v0.4.0)

* **Screenshot capture:** Press **LEFT_THUMB (left stick click) + LT trigger** simultaneously during gameplay to capture screenshots. Screenshots are saved to `game:\snaps\` as PNG files using the ROM filename (e.g., `SuperMario-0.png`). Latch mechanism prevents multiple screenshots per button press.

---

## What's new (v0.3.1)

* **Fast Forward:** Press and hold **RT (Right Trigger)** during gameplay to speed up emulation at 2x speed. Release to return to normal speed. No configuration needed.

---

## What's new (v0.3.0)

* **In-game OSD & auto-pause:** Press **START + BACK** during gameplay to open the OSD. Emulation **pauses on entry** and **resumes on exit**.
* **Save states with slots:** Save/Load using a slot selector (0‚Äì9) from the OSD.
* **Quick Reset:** Restart the current game from the OSD.
* **GFX settings (experimental):** Toggle fullscreen/TV bezel and software filter presets. *Known to be a little buggy; see ‚ÄúKnown Issues.‚Äù*
* No changes to the emulator core (APU/PPU/CPU/mappers).

---

## What's new (v0.2)

* **Time-based acceleration on Right Stick (RS):** Start precise, then ramp speed the longer you hold in one direction. Deflection magnitude also scales step size; hard caps prevent runaway scroll on huge libraries.
* **Held paging (LB/RB):** Hold a shoulder button to page up/down at a steady cadence.
* **Sane UX guards:** Minimum dwell to prevent double-steps, direction/neutral resets, and a deadzone so tiny bumps don't spam moves.
* **Precision preserved:** D-pad / Left Stick keep XUI's native single-step behavior for fine selection.

## Repository layout (excerpt)

* `fceux/` ‚Äì Visual Studio 2008 solution and Xbox 360 project.
* `fceux/xbox/` ‚Äì Xbox front-end (UI, input, filesystem glue).
* `fceux/xbox/ui/mainui.cpp` ‚Äì XUI scenes (ROM browser, **OSD**, emulation runner). **Scrolling & OSD glue live here.**
* `fceux/media/` ‚Äì Static assets (XUI skin `ui.xzp`, font `xarialuni.ttf`, textures).
* Core emulation lives under `fceux/fceux/` and is intentionally untouched.

---

## Build

1. Open `fceux\fceux.sln` in Visual Studio 2008 SP1.
2. Select Configuration: `Release_LTCG` and Platform: `Xbox 360`.
3. Build the `fceux` project.

Notes

* Post-build may warn:

  * `xbecopy: error X1001: Could not connect to Xbox 360 ''`
  * Expected if Neighborhood isn‚Äôt configured. The `.xex` still builds.
  * To silence, clear **Project Properties ‚Üí Build Events ‚Üí Post-Build**.
* Typical era/toolchain warnings are harmless here (e.g., `/GR-` RTTI notes, `FASTCALL` macro noise).

## Deploy to Xbox 360 (RGH/JTAG)

Create this layout on the console (e.g., `HDD1:\Emulators\FCEUX360\`):

```
FCEUX360\
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ media\          # copy everything from repo fceux\media\
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ roms\           # put .nes/.zip here
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ snaps\          # screenshots (optional)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ states\         # save-states
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ fceui.ini       # created at runtime; can be an empty file initially
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ fceux.xex       # from fceux\Release_LTCG\
```

Steps

* Copy `fceux\Release_LTCG\fceux.xex` to the folder above.
* Copy all contents of `fceux\media\` into `media\` next to the `.xex` (**must** include `ui.xzp` and `xarialuni.ttf`).
* Launch `fceux.xex` from Aurora/FSD/XEXMenu. The first time you change a setting, `fceui.ini` will be written.

## Controls (front-end & OSD)

### ROM Browser

* **Recent Games:** Last 15 played ROMs appear at the top with `[Recent]` prefix and separator line. Automatically updated when games are loaded.
* **Y:** **Search** ‚Äî Open Xbox keyboard to search ROMs by name. Filters list in real-time with case-insensitive partial matching.
* **Right Stick (hold up/down):** *Time-based acceleration* of selection.
* **LB / RB (hold):** Page up / page down at a steady cadence.
* **D-pad / Left Stick:** Single-step precision (native XUI behavior).
* **A:** Load game & start emulation.
* **B:** Back.

### In-Game

* **RT (Right Trigger):** **Fast Forward** ‚Äî Hold to speed up emulation at 2x speed. Release to return to normal speed.
* **LEFT_THUMB + LT:** **Screenshot** ‚Äî Press simultaneously to capture a screenshot. Saved to `game:\snaps\` using ROM filename (e.g., `SuperMario-0.png`).
* **START + BACK:** Open **OSD** (auto-pause).
* **OSD actions:** Save/Load State (with slots), Reset Game, GFX options (experimental). Exiting OSD resumes gameplay; "Load Game" returns to ROM browser.

---

## Advanced tuning (optional)

All tunables live in the ROM list scene (`LoadGame` in `fceux/xbox/ui/mainui.cpp`):

* **Deadzone (RS):** `const float RS_DEADZONE = ~0.28‚Äì0.30f`
* **Held paging cadence (LB/RB):** `const DWORD pageRepeatMs = ~100;`
* **General dwell/response:**

  ```
  m_initialDelayMs   = 180;  // initial repeat delay
  m_repeatIntervalMs = 70;   // baseline cadence (non-RS path)
  m_minDwellMs       = 50;   // minimum time between injected moves
  ```
* **Acceleration tiers (RS hold time):** ramps from ~150‚Äì160 ms (1 step) down to ~35 ms (3 steps) after ~2.6s hold; deflection magnitude scales steps.

## Packaging builds for GitHub Releases

Attach a zip containing:

```
FCEUX360-<version>-xex.zip
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ FCEUX360\
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ fceux.xex
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ fceui.ini              # optional seed (empty)
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ media\                 # from repo
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ roms\                  # empty
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ snaps\                 # empty
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ states\                # empty
```

## Troubleshooting

* **OSD doesn‚Äôt open:** Must be *in-game* (emulation scene active). Press **START + BACK** simultaneously. Ensure `ui.xzp` contains the OSD scenes and that your tab order puts OSD reachable from the emulation scene (default uses `GoToNext()`).
* **GFX settings revert or don‚Äôt apply:** Known issue; sometimes UI state and renderer can desync on scene changes. Work is in progress to harden state propagation and persistence.
* **‚ÄúHolding longer doesn‚Äôt speed up‚Äù:** Acceleration is on **Right Stick**; D-pad/Left Stick remain single-step. Check the RS deadzone and stick calibration.
* **Black UI or missing text:** Verify `media\ui.xzp` and `media\xarialuni.ttf` are present.
* **Empty ROM list:** Place `.nes`/`.zip` files under `roms\`.
* **Screenshots not saving:** Ensure you're pressing LEFT_THUMB (stick click, not movement) + LT trigger simultaneously. Verify `game:\snaps\` directory exists and has write permissions.
* **Post-build copy error:** Expected without Neighborhood; deploy via FTP manually.
